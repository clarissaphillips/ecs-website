		<h2><b>My Interests</b></h2>
		<p>As a Sociology major I am largely interested in Perceptions of Self as well as Cultural Identity, and both the psychological and physical ways they affect development.
			<br><br>
			My affinity for Computer Science comes primarily from my love of creativity and problem solving among other things. Since taking my first class in the field, my preliminary interest in CS has grown into a deep admiration, and as such I am looking for a career that is at least tangentially related to Computer Science and Technology.
			<br><br>
			In regards to my future career prospects, I am not entirely sure what I want to do yet, but my prospects include Law, HR, Project Management and Computer Administration among other things.
